## Agent Overview

### What is a Microsoft Foundry Agent?

A Microsoft Foundry Agent is an intelligent system that understands user requests and performs tasks using appropriate tools and knowledge.

### Key Components

```
Agent = Model + Instructions + Tools + Knowledge
```

- **Model**: Base language model (GPT-5.1, Claude, etc.)
- **Instructions**: Agent behavior guidelines and persona
- **Tools**: File Search, Web Search, Function Calling, etc.
- **Knowledge**: Connected knowledge base (Foundry IQ)

### Agent Types

| Type | Description | Use Cases |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Conversational** | Dialogue-oriented agent | Chatbots, customer support |
| **Task-oriented** | Task-focused agent | Data analysis, document generation |
| **Retrieval-augmented** | Search-based agent | Knowledge base QA |
| **Multi-agent** | Multi-agent collaboration | Complex workflows |

     ```
   
   ![Verify publish completion](../assets/03-25-agent-published.png)

### Invoking Agents

#### 1. Azure CLI Login

First log in to Azure:

```bash
az login 
```

If using multi-tenant, specify tenant ID:
```bash
az login --tenant <tenant-id>
```

#### 2. Invoke Using Python SDK

> 💡 **Practice Tip**: The code below is for reference. During practice, open the `invokeAgent.py` file in the root path of this repository, modify `FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT` and `AGENT_NAME` values for your environment, then execute.

Example `invokeAgent.py` file:

```python
# Microsoft Foundry Agent Invocation using Activity Protocol
from openai import OpenAI
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

# TODO: Update these values with your actual Microsoft Foundry details
# Get these from: https://ai.azure.com → Your Project → Deployments
FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT = "https://<foundry-resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>"
AGENT_NAME = "ModelRouterAgent"  # Name of agent to invoke
API_VERSION = "2025-11-15-preview"

# Create OpenAI client with Azure authentication
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=get_bearer_token_provider(
        DefaultAzureCredential(), 
        "https://ai.azure.com/.default"
    ),
    base_url=f"{FOUNDRY_ENDPOINT}/applications/{AGENT_NAME}/protocols/openai",
    default_query={"api-version": API_VERSION}
)

try:
    # Call the agent using responses API
    response = client.responses.create(
        input="Recommend a 2 night 3 day travel itinerary for Jeju Island"
    )
    
    print(f"Response: {response.output_text}")
    
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    print("\n🔍 Troubleshooting:")
    print("1. Check your endpoint URL at https://ai.azure.com")
    print("2. Verify the project name and agent name exist")
    print("3. Ensure you're logged in: az login")
    print("4. Confirm the agent is deployed and running")
```

#### 3. Check Endpoint Information

How to check endpoint information in Foundry portal:

1. Select published agent in Build > Agents
2. Click **Publish** button, then click **View details**
3. Copy the following information:
   - Agent application
   - Activity Protocol endpoint
   - Response API endpoint

![Check Endpoint information](../assets/03-26-agent-endpoint.png)

#### 4. Execute

```bash
# Create virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages (including pre-release version)
pip install openai azure-identity
pip install --pre azure-ai-projects

# Run script
python invokeAgent.py
```

### 🔐 Authentication Options

#### Option 1: DefaultAzureCredential (Recommended)
```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
```

#### Option 2: Managed Identity (When running on Azure resources)
```python
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
credential = ManagedIdentityCredential()
```

#### Option 3: Service Principal
```python
from azure.identity import ClientSecretCredential
credential = ClientSecretCredential(
    tenant_id="YOUR_TENANT_ID",
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
)
```

### ✅ Verification Checklist

- Verify agent published successfully
- Confirm Python script runs without errors
- Check response returns as expected
