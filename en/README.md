This workshop covers the following topics using Microsoft Foundry's new portal:

- **Model Management**: Deploy various AI models and configure Model Router
- **Agent Development**: Build File Search, Web Search, and Knowledge-based agents
- **Foundry IQ**: Construct knowledge base using AI Search and Blob Storage
- **Workflows**: Design Sequential, Group Chat, and Human-in-loop workflows
- **Evaluations**: Evaluate and analyze agent performance
- **Management**: Operational monitoring through Control Plane

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start with Environment Setup**: Create necessary Azure resources by following [01-setup.md](./01-setup.md).

2. **Sequential learning recommended**: Since each module utilizes resources from previous modules, we recommend progressing in order.

3. **Select only needed parts**: If you're interested in specific features, you can select and practice only those sections.
