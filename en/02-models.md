## Deploy Embedding Model

Embedding models convert text into vectors, enabling semantic search and similarity calculations.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Search for Embedding Model**
   - Enter **"text-embedding"** in the search box on the Discover > Models page.
   - You can use filters to display only Embedding models.
   
   ![Search text-embedding](../assets/02-08-embedding-search.png)

2. **Select text-embedding-3-large**
   - Select the **text-embedding-3-large** model.
   - Review model details:
     - Dimensions: 3072
   
   ![text-embedding-3-large model card](../assets/02-09-embedding-model-card.png)

3. **Deployment Configuration**
   ```
   Deployment name: text-embedding-3-large
   Model version: [Latest version]
   Deployment type: Standard
   ```

4. **Execute Deployment**
   - Click the **Deploy** button to deploy.

## Deploy Model Router

Model Router provides intelligent routing across multiple models to optimize cost, quality, and performance.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Search for Model Router**
   - Search for **"model-router"** in Discover > Models.
   
   ![Search model-router](../assets/02-11-model-router-search.png)

2. **Review Model Router Information**
   - Key features of Model Router:
     - Automatic model selection
     - Load balancing
     - Cost optimization
     - Quality-based routing

3. **Deployment Configuration**
   ```
   Deployment name: model-router
   Routing strategy: Balanced (default)
   Included models: [Automatically detected available models]
   ```
   
   ![Model Router deployment settings](../assets/02-12-model-router-deploy.png)

4. **Complete Deployment**
   - Click the **Deploy** button.
   - Model Router automatically detects available deployed models.

### ✅ Verification Checklist

- Verify `model-router` deployment in Build > Models
- Check deployment status
- Verify list of models accessible to the Router

## Configure Model Router

Configure the Model Router's routing strategy to align with your application requirements and optimize performance.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Navigate to Model Router Details Page**
   - Go to Build > Models section.
   - Click the deployed **model-router**.

2. **Enter Edit Mode**
   - Select the **Details** tab.
   - Click the **Edit** button.
   
   ![Model Router settings screen (Edit mode)](../assets/02-13-model-router-config.png)

3. **Model Router Configuration**
   
   #### Routing Mode Options:
   
   ![Routing Mode options](../assets/02-14-model-router-modes.png)
   
   **a) Balanced Mode**
   ```
   Description: Maintains balance between cost, quality, and performance
   Use case: General production workloads
   Behavior: Automatically selects appropriate model based on request
   ```

   **b) Quality Mode**
   ```
   Description: Prioritizes highest quality responses
   Use case: Applications where accuracy is critical
   Behavior: Prioritizes best performing models
   Cost: Relatively higher cost
   ```

   **c) Cost Mode**
   ```
   Description: Prioritizes cost optimization
   Use case: Processing large volumes of simple requests
   Behavior: Prioritizes cost-efficient models
   Quality: Maintains basic quality
   ```

4. **Select Routing Mode**
   - For the workshop, select **Balanced** mode.
   - You can change to other modes as needed.

5. **Save and Apply**
   - Click the **Save** button to save settings.
   - Changes are applied immediately.

### 📊 Model Router Operation Example

```
User request → Model Router → Decision:
  - Simple question → GPT-5-nano (low cost)
  - Complex analysis → GPT-5-mini (high quality)
  - Code generation → Codex family
  - High load → Load balancing
```

### 💡 Optimization Tips

- **Development environment**: Cost Mode for cost savings
- **Production**: Balanced Mode for stability
- **Customer-facing service**: Quality Mode for user experience
- **A/B Testing**: Compare performance across modes
